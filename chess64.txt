DESC "an UCI compatible cross-platform chess engine by Richard Vida. Starting in late 2008, Critter was first written in Object Pascal compiled with Delphi, now available as open source engine, and was ported to C / C++ in 2009. It consistently evolved through various board representations from 0x88 to bitboards, as acknowledged by Richard Vida, also incorporating ideas from strong open source programs like Ippolit, to a world class engine which achieved top five of most engine rating lists. In 2012, Critter had its over the board debut at the ICT 2012, where it became strong runner-up behind the Rybka cluster. "
